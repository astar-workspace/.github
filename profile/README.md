Welcome to `astar.workspace`, the personal organization of [astarivi](https://github.com/astarivi).

This space hosts some of my personal projects, experiments and tools. The primary purpose of this organization is to seamlessly share CI runners and related infrastructure across my projects.

## What's inside?

- CI aware projects
- Tooling and workflows
- Self hosted CI runners

**Note:** If you have questions, or would like to discuss anything related to the projects in this organization, please reach out to me directly rather than contacting this organization.
